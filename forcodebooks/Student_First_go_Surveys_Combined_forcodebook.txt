Q173 Please read the following terms carefully. 
    
  
ESSEXLab Omnibus Survey   
The ESSEXLab Omnibus survey contains both demographic questions and common 
psychological scales.  We are collecting this data on members of our recruitment database to 
save both you and our researchers time in the lab and during online surveys by storing the data 
and linking it to future studies. 
 
 
Demographic information will be used to update your profile in the ESSEXLab participant 
database.  You may edit this data at any time by signing into your participant account at 
www.essexlab.essex.ac.uk/hroot    
 
The other information collected in the Omnibus survey will be provided to researchers for use in 
their individual studies, linked by an anonymous ID code.  The ESSEXLab team will not provide 
any identifying information to researchers, only the data from the Omnibus survey with your 
anonymous ID code.    
    
Your participation in this study is purely voluntary, and you may withdraw your participation or 
your data at any time without any penalty to you.   If you wish to do so, please contact the 
Laboratory Manager (essexlab@essex.ac.uk).  
     
Data Protection: 
The participant database is stored in the Data Archive's secure servers, which are certified to 
ISO 27001, the international security standard. Decisions taken by participants during 
experimental sessions will be recorded by the computer software. These decisions will not be 
linked with your personal data stored on the ESSEXLab Online Recruitment System. Unless 
otherwise stated during the session, your choices during the experiment will be anonymous, and 
payments will be made privately and confidentially. 
    
All research done in the Lab has passed ethical requirements, including requirements for 
confidentiality. See the University of Essex's ethical procedures. Participation in the ESSEXLab 
Omnibus is optional, but you may be invited to fewer experiments if you do not and researchers 
are interested in using the Omnibus as part of their research study. You are entitled to request 
that your data held as part of the ESSEXLab participant database or ESSEXLab Omnibus be 
removed at any time.  To do so, please contact the Laboratory Manager 
(essexlab@essex.ac.uk).
