Labels_P = file containing all the labels from Patrick's Survey

Labels_DNS = file containing all the labels from David's Non-student survey

Labels_DS = file containing all the labels from David's Student survey

Unique Labels = file containing the whole list of unique labels across all surveys ( this is just a single column list), 
                made to be easily imported in R

Labels_comparison_P_DNS_DS = file which compares how the different variables correspond to one another across all the surveys. 
                There are three columns that correspond to the 3 surveys and have the following values:
      same = when the label name is identical in the survey
      no - doesn't exist = when that label does not exist at all in the survey
      different name = when the label exists for the same data, but under a different name (for example: the label "consent" appears
                       with the identical name in Patrick's survey and therefore in Patrick's column there is a "same" value, while in 
                       the other two surveys appears as Q144 or Q145, for which there is a "different name" value in the respective 
                       columns
